# CloudF
Create a cloudformation template that deploys an auto-scaling group and also a launch conf. For the launch configuration, parametirzed the AMI and also the instance size. I need you to create a nested stack solution and use the VPC templates that you wrote before to prepare the network componets and launch on it the launch conf and auto-scaling.
